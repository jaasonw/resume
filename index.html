    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      My name is Jason and I'm a computer science major at Cal State Fullerton
      and a software developer. I enjoy building software from the ground up and from 
      front to back.
      <br>
      <br>
      Here are some technologies I have been working with recently
      <ul id="skills">
        <li>Flutter</li>
        <li>Firebase</li>
        <li>Flask</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Where I've worked</h1>

        I'm currently a software developer for <a href="http://twiine.com">Twiine</a>, an app 
        that helps plan optimal hangouts based on preferences and moods.<br>
        Our app is built on Flutter and our backend is powered by Firebase. On the mobile app,
        I've implemented several of the major pages and components. On the 
        backend, I've implemented features such as account creation and sending hangout requests.

        When I attended PCC I worked as a computer science tutor, helping students 
        understand computer science concepts as well as debug code.
